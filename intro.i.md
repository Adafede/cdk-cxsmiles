# Core Structures

At the Dagstuhl Computation Metabolomics meeting there was a session about core structures.
The research question here is what the right balance is of representation of multiple
structures, matching measured data. [ChemAxon exteneded SMILES](https://chemaxon.com/marvin-archive/latest/help/formats/cxsmiles-doc.html),
or <topic>CxSMILES</topic>, came up as one solution [<cite>Q83868396</cite>].
This repository contains code using the <topic>Chemistry Development Kit</topic> [<cite>Q27061829</cite>,<cite>Q27065423</cite>,<cite>Q30149558</cite>]
for various tasks around this question. The following chapters discuss these.
