# Introduction

At the Dagstuhl Computation Metabolomics meeting there was a session about core structures.
The research question here is what the right balance is of representation of multiple
structures, matching measured data. [ChemAxon extended SMILES](https://chemaxon.com/marvin-archive/latest/help/formats/cxsmiles-doc.html),
or <topic>CxSMILES</topic>, came up as one solution [<cite>Q83868396</cite>,<cite>Q111904945</cite>].
This repository contains code using the <topic>Chemistry Development Kit</topic> [<cite>Q27061829</cite>,<cite>Q27065423</cite>,<cite>Q30149558</cite>]
for various tasks around this question. The following chapters discuss these.

## CxSMILES in Wikidata

Prior to the Computation Metabolomics 2022 meeting a proposal was made to add a Wikidata
property for CxSMILES which was approved during the meeting. The SPARQL query
[https://w.wiki/58rF](https://w.wiki/58rF) returns a list of Wikidata items with a
CxSMILES value.
