# Core Structures

At the Dagstuhl Computation Metabolomics meeting there was a session about core structures.
The research question here is what the right balance is of representation of multiple
structures, matching measured data. CXSMILES came up as one solution.
This repository contains code using the Chemistry Development Kit [<cite>Q27061829</cite>,<cite>Q27065423</cite>,<cite>Q30149558</cite>]
for various tasks around this question. The following chapters discuss these.
