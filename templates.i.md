# Classes of compounds and where to find a CxSMILES

## Lipids

### Lipids with a double bond somewhere in the tail

If we have a single tail lipid with `x+y+2` carbons in the tail but we do not
know the location of the double bond, we can use a CxSMILES like
`[H]C\\C=C\\CC(=O)O |Sg:n:1:x:ht,Sg:n:4:y:ht| x+y=17`:
