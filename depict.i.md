# Depiction of CXSMILES

This section will contain the Groovy script to do the depiction too, but
for now you can use the online [CDK Depict tool](https://www.simolecule.com/cdkdepict/depict.html).

## Groovy code

We can also create depictions of CXSMILES with Groovy code, here for a class of lipids:

<code>CXSMILESDepict</code>

The output looks like this:
