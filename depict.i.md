# Depiction of CxSMILES

This section will contain the Groovy script to do the depiction too, but
for now you can use the online [CDK Depict tool](https://www.simolecule.com/cdkdepict/depict.html).

## Groovy code

We can also create depictions of CxSMILES with Groovy code, here for a class of lipids:

<code>CXSMILESDepict</code>

The output looks like this:

<img src="./images/generated/lipids.svg" width="400" alt="SVG depiction of the lipds" />
