# Liebisch abbreviations

The Liebisch abbrevations are a shorthand notation for lipid structures. This is particularly useful
when the lipid is incompletely characterized [<cite>Q40470345</cite>,<cite>Q100512153</cite>].

For example, we can use the following code to depict `CE 16:1`, using CXSMILES as intermediate step:

<code>DepictLipidAbbrev</code>

The output looks like this:

<img src="./images/generated/CE_16:1.svg" width="400" alt="Depiction of the 2D structure of CE 16:1" />

## Some examples

Instead of depicting, we can just output the CXSMILES generated from the shorthand notation:

<code>LiebischExamples</code>

The output looks like this:

<out>LiebischExamples</out>
