# Creating CXSMILES

This chapter covers the following use case: experiment data has provided
a short list of possible chemical structures, for example, resulting from
a database search on molecular formula or m/z value. Often, the top hits
of posititional isomers, and the wish exists to convert these isomers
into a Markush structure and represented as CXSMILES.

## Maximal Common Substructure

<code>MCS</code>

## SDF in, CXSMILES out
